# Step 1: Set up GitHub Repository
## What's this all about?
In this step you will create a GitHub repository (repo), open it in Visual Studio Code and commit a change to the README file to make sure everything is working as intended.

## Known gotchas

1. At certain points you may need to authenticate if you haven't done a particular linking step before. This will require you to remember your password and/or use the MFA system in GitHub.

2. I am showing screen grabs from the GitHub desktop app here. If you are more used to using the command line, please do as you see fit. The results will be the same. 

## Create the repo
In your GitHub account click 'New'. At the time of writing it looks like this.

You will then be presented with a form to fill out. I am initialising here with a Node .gitignore file as we will be writing in Node for this project. I have also asked for a README file. Everyone loves documentation!

## Testing everything is linked up

On the VS Code side pannel you will see this when you have changes to commit.

Clicking on it brings up the source control pannel

Use the command line if you like but you can also commit here

On the bottom bar you will see the sync button showing how far you are ahead of the remote master
