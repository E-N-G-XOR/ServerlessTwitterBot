# ServerlessTwitterBot
Code along instructions for building 'My first Twitter bot with Azure Serverless and GitHub Actions'.

## Prerequisites

To be able to build along with this tutorial you will need.

1. An Azure account ([find out more](https://azure.microsoft.com/)). This walk through expects some level of Azure experience. While I have given a lot of detail and screen grabs of the various stages your experience will help you move through much quicker. If you are setting up a Free Azure account for the first time you may wish to do some general tutorials first to understand how the portal works and some base terminology (for example, 'resource' and 'resource group').
2. A GitHub account ([find out more](https://github.com/)). It is very stragith forward to set up a Github account but the concepts of source control are only covered in passing in this walk through. I hope to have covered 'what you need' here but you may wish to explore other learning materials, like [First Day On GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths/first-day-on-github) if you want more context.
3. A Twitter account ([find out more](https://twitter.com)). You can use your personal Twitter account if you want to. To create a new Twitter account will require it's own associated email address. If you don't have a second account you could look at signing up for one at [Outlook.com](https://outlook.com/)
4. Visual Studio Code ([find out more](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
5. Visual Studio Code Azure Functions Extension ([find out more](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)).
6. Azure Functions code tools ([find out more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)).

3. Create the Function locally ([details](https://github.com/TheRealCodeBeard/ServerlessTwitterBot/blob/master/STEP3.md))
4. Push the Function to Azure ([details](https://github.com/TheRealCodeBeard/ServerlessTwitterBot/blob/master/STEP4.md))
5. Build the Logic App ([details](https://github.com/TheRealCodeBeard/ServerlessTwitterBot/blob/master/STEP5.md))
6. Set up a GitHub Action ([details](https://github.com/TheRealCodeBeard/ServerlessTwitterBot/blob/master/STEP6.md))
